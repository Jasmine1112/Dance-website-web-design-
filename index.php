	<h1>Why dancing is so fascinating</h1>
	<p> 
		Our ancestors painted their cave walls with pictures of dancers. Even babies instinctively jig in time to music. Dancing feels good - and while some societies ban it, there is no culture on earth that doesn't possess an urge to dance.
	</p>
	<p>
		But how is it that such a simple physical act has the ability to lift the spirits? The reasons, say dance psychologist Dr Peter Lovatt of the University of Hertfordshire, are four-fold. "Dancing stimulates us physically and emotionally while there are also cognitive and social elements to it," he explains.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You appear to get a much bigger release of endorphins when you dance than during other forms of exercise; it also connects with the emotional centres in the brain. For many people, dancing prompts an emotional release - often that's uncomplicated happiness, while for some it can make them cry. It's cathartic - a letting go of pent-up emotions."

		Experiments have proved the cognitive benefits of dancing. University researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of people and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes. Each had to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened or to get up and dance. All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after.
	</p>
	<p>
		Dr Lovatt says: "All those who chose to dance displayed improved problem-solving skills afterwards. This same study also found that the mood levels of the dancers went up. It shows that dancing along to music even for five minutes can boost happiness and improve creative-thinking patterns."
	</p>
	<p>
		Dancing also improves spatial awareness, as well as raising the heart rate and causing a release of feel-good endorphins into the bloodstream. One more benefit is that it helps reduce levels of cortisol - a stress hormone. "That's another reason why it makes you feel happy and more relaxed," says fitness expert Matt Roots.
